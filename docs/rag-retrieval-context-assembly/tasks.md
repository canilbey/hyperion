# RAG Retrieval & Context Assembly - Technical Tasks

## Milestone 1: Query Embedding & Vector Search (High Priority)

- **Implement query embedding logic**
  - Purpose: Convert user queries into vector representations for search.
  - Design: Use the same embedding model as document chunks; support batch and real-time embedding.
  - Dependencies: Embedding model and configuration.

- **Implement vector search in Milvus**
  - Purpose: Retrieve relevant vectors from Milvus based on query embedding.
  - Design: API endpoint for vector search, support for top-k retrieval and filtering.
  - Dependencies: Milvus connection and collection setup.

## Milestone 2: Metadata Filtering & Context Assembly (Medium Priority)

- **Implement metadata-based filtering**
  - Purpose: Filter search results by metadata (e.g., model_name, document type).
  - Design: Query construction with metadata filters, validation, and error handling.
  - Dependencies: Metadata schema and mapping.

- **Implement context assembly logic**
  - Purpose: Assemble retrieved vectors and metadata into context for LLM input.
  - Design: Context formatting, size/token limits, and user context propagation.
  - Dependencies: Vector search and filtering output.

## Milestone 3: Advanced Retrieval & Quality (Medium/Low Priority)

- **Implement re-ranking and semantic chunking (optional)**
  - Purpose: Improve retrieval quality with re-ranking models and semantic chunking.
  - Design: Integrate cross-encoder or re-ranker, chunking logic for long contexts.
  - Dependencies: Re-ranking model, chunking config.

- **Add logging and error handling**
  - Purpose: Log all operations and handle errors consistently.
  - Design: Structured logging, error categorization, integration with observability stack.
  - Dependencies: Logging infrastructure.

- **Write unit and integration tests**
  - Purpose: Ensure reliability and correctness with automated tests.
  - Design: Test cases for all flows, edge cases, and error conditions.
  - Dependencies: Test framework, Milvus connection.

- **Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger**
  - Purpose: Provide interactive API documentation.
  - Design: Endpoint descriptions, input/output schemas, and error codes.
  - Dependencies: API implementation.
