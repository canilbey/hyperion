# Vector Database Integration (Milvus) - Technical Tasks

## Milestone 1: Collection & Schema Management (High Priority)

- **Design Milvus collection and schema**
  - Purpose: Define the structure for storing embeddings and associated metadata.
  - Design: Collection fields for vectors, IDs, and metadata; index configuration for efficient search.
  - Dependencies: Milvus instance must be available.

- **Implement collection and index creation logic**
  - Purpose: Automate the setup of collections and indexes in Milvus.
  - Design: API or internal logic for collection creation, index building, and schema validation.
  - Dependencies: Milvus connection and configuration.

## Milestone 2: Embedding Ingestion & Storage (Medium Priority)

- **Implement embedding ingestion endpoint**
  - Purpose: Store embeddings and metadata in Milvus (and optionally PostgreSQL).
  - Design: API endpoint for batch and real-time ingestion, input validation, and error handling.
  - Dependencies: Collection and schema setup.

- **Implement metadata management and separation**
  - Purpose: Store and manage metadata for model-based data separation and filtering.
  - Design: Metadata mapping, storage in Milvus or PostgreSQL, and query support.
  - Dependencies: Metadata schema, DB connection.

## Milestone 3: Vector Search & Performance (Medium/Low Priority)

- **Implement vector search endpoint**
  - Purpose: Enable efficient similarity search over stored embeddings.
  - Design: API endpoint for vector search, filtering by metadata, and result ranking.
  - Dependencies: Collection, index, and metadata setup.

- **Add performance tuning and scaling logic**
  - Purpose: Optimize search and ingestion performance for large-scale data.
  - Design: Index tuning, sharding, and resource monitoring.
  - Dependencies: Milvus configuration, monitoring stack.

## Dependencies
- Running Milvus instance (standalone or cluster)
- PostgreSQL instance for metadata (optional)
- FastAPI core setup
- Logging/monitoring stack

## Responsible Roles
- Backend Developer (Vector DB, API)
- DevOps Engineer (Milvus, scaling)
- QA Engineer (Testing)
