# Vector Database Integration (Milvus) - Project Overview

## Purpose
The Vector Database Integration sub-project is responsible for managing the storage, indexing, and retrieval of vector embeddings using Milvus. It enables high-performance semantic search and supports metadata-based filtering for the Hyperion platform.

## Scope
- Milvus collection and schema management
- Storing and indexing embeddings with metadata
- Efficient vector search and similarity queries
- Metadata-based filtering and model-based data separation
- Performance tuning and scaling
- Logging, error handling, and observability

## Architecture
- FastAPI service for vector database operations
- Milvus as the primary vector storage and search engine
- Metadata storage in Milvus or auxiliary database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Batch and real-time ingestion support
- Logging and monitoring integrated with Prometheus and ELK

## Technologies
- FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
- Milvus (vector database)
- PostgreSQL (optional, for metadata)
- Monitoring: Prometheus, ELK stack

## Dependencies
- Running Milvus instance (standalone or cluster)
- PostgreSQL instance for metadata (optional)
- Environment variables for Milvus and DB connections, monitoring endpoints
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Configuration Requirements
- Milvus collection and index configuration
- Metadata schema and mapping
- Logging and monitoring endpoints

## Integration Points
- Receives embeddings from Embedding & Vectorization module
- Provides vector search results to RAG Retrieval & Context Assembly
- Exposes OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for integration
- System-wide logging and monitoring

## Workflow Description
- Receives embeddings and metadata for storage
- Stores vectors in Milvus and metadata in Milvus or PostgreSQL
- Handles vector search and filtering queries
- Returns results for downstream retrieval and ranking
- All actions are logged and monitored
