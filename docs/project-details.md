# Project Details

## Purpose
To build a modular, scalable, and secure platform for chat-based document retrieval and interaction, leveraging LLMs, vector databases, and modern DevOps practices.

## Scope
- User management and authentication
- Real-time chat and conversation management
- Document ingestion, parsing, and metadata handling
- Embedding and vectorization of text data
- Integration with Milvus for vector storage and search
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows
- Frontend application for user interaction
- Workflow automation and orchestration
- Observability, monitoring, and DevOps

## Key Requirements
- Secure user authentication (JWT, RBAC)
- Scalable chat and document processing
- Efficient embedding and vector search
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Automated pipelines for document and embedding workflows
- Centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting
- CI/CD and containerized deployment

## Success Criteria
- All core modules are independently deployable and testable
- End-to-end chat and document retrieval workflows function reliably
- System meets performance, security, and scalability targets
- Monitoring and alerting provide actionable insights
- Documentation and tests cover all major components
