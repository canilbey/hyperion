# Observability, Monitoring & DevOps - Project Overview

## Purpose
The Observability, Monitoring & DevOps sub-project is responsible for ensuring the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of the Hyperion platform. It provides centralized logging, metrics, alerting, CI/CD automation, and containerized deployment for all services.

## Scope
- Centralized logging and log aggregation (ELK stack)
- Metrics collection and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Alerting and incident response
- CI/CD pipeline setup and automation
- Docker-based development and Kubernetes-based production deployment
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and environment management
- Security, rate limiting, and compliance

## Architecture
- ELK stack for log aggregation and search
- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and dashboards
- Alertmanager for incident response
- GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for CI/CD pipelines
- Docker for local development, Kubernetes for production
- IaC tools (Terraform, Helm) for infrastructure management

## Technologies
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
- Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD
- Terraform (optional)

## Dependencies
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Container registry and CI/CD runners
- Kubernetes cluster for production
- Environment variables for secrets and configuration

## Configuration Requirements
- Log and metric endpoint configuration
- Alerting rules and notification channels
- CI/CD pipeline and deployment settings
- Security and compliance policies

## Integration Points
- Collects logs and metrics from all backend and frontend services
- Provides dashboards and alerts to DevOps and engineering teams
- Integrates with CI/CD for automated build, test, and deployment
- System-wide security and compliance enforcement

## Workflow Description
- Aggregates logs and metrics from all services
- Monitors system health and triggers alerts on incidents
- Automates build, test, and deployment pipelines
- Manages infrastructure and environment configuration
- Ensures security and compliance across the platform
