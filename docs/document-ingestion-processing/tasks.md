# Document Ingestion & Processing - Technical Tasks

## Milestone 1: File Upload & Management (High Priority)

- **Implement PDF/text file upload endpoint**
  - Purpose: Allow users to upload documents to the system.
  - Design: API endpoint for file upload, validation, and storage (local/S3/DB).
  - Dependencies: Storage backend and schema must be ready.

- **Implement file management and metadata storage**
  - Purpose: Store and manage uploaded files with associated metadata.
  - Design: Metadata extraction (filename, size, type, user, upload date), storage in DB.
  - Dependencies: Database schema for files and metadata.

## Milestone 2: Document Parsing & Chunking (Medium Priority)

- **Implement document parsing for PDF/text**
  - Purpose: Extract text from uploaded documents.
  - Design: Use PDF/text parsing libraries, handle encoding and errors.
  - Dependencies: Parsing libraries, file access.

- **Implement chunking logic**
  - Purpose: Split documents into manageable text chunks for downstream processing.
  - Design: Chunking strategy (by size, section, or semantic boundaries).
  - Dependencies: Parsing output, chunking config.

- **Add OCR support for scanned documents**
  - Purpose: Enable text extraction from images and scanned PDFs.
  - Design: Integrate Tesseract or similar OCR library, handle multi-page and multi-language.
  - Dependencies: OCR library installed and configured.

- **Add multi-column document support**
  - Purpose: Handle documents with complex layouts (e.g., multi-column PDFs).
  - Design: Use advanced parsing or layout analysis tools.
  - Dependencies: Parsing library with layout support.

## Milestone 3: Quality & Observability (Medium/Low Priority)

- **Add logging and error handling**
  - Purpose: Log all operations and handle errors consistently.
  - Design: Structured logging, error categorization, integration with observability stack.
  - Dependencies: Logging infrastructure.

- **Write unit and integration tests**
  - Purpose: Ensure reliability and correctness with automated tests.
  - Design: Test cases for all flows, edge cases, and error conditions.
  - Dependencies: Test framework, storage backend.

- **Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger**
  - Purpose: Provide interactive API documentation.
  - Design: Endpoint descriptions, input/output schemas, and error codes.
  - Dependencies: API implementation.

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL or S3/local storage for files and metadata
