# Document Ingestion & Processing - Project Overview

## Purpose
The Document Ingestion & Processing sub-project is responsible for handling the upload, parsing, chunking, and metadata extraction of documents (PDF/text) for the Hyperion platform. It ensures reliable document management and prepares data for downstream embedding and retrieval workflows.

## Scope
- Upload and manage PDF/text files
- Parse documents and extract text content
- Chunk documents for efficient processing
- OCR support for scanned documents and images
- Multi-column and complex layout handling
- Metadata extraction and management
- Logging, error handling, and observability

## Architecture
- Modular FastAPI service structure
- Persistent storage for uploaded files and metadata (e.g., PostgreSQL, S3, or local storage)
- OCR integration (e.g., Tesseract) for scanned documents
- Document parsing and chunking pipeline
- Logging and monitoring integrated with Prometheus and ELK

## Technologies
- FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
- PostgreSQL or S3/local storage (file/metadata storage)
- Tesseract OCR (for scanned documents)
- PDF/text parsing libraries (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, etc.)
- Monitoring: Prometheus, ELK stack

## Dependencies
- Running PostgreSQL or S3/local storage for files and metadata
- OCR library (Tesseract) installed and configured
- Environment variables for storage, OCR, and monitoring endpoints
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Configuration Requirements
- Database schema for file and metadata storage
- OCR configuration and language packs
- Logging and monitoring endpoints

## Integration Points
- Provides parsed and chunked documents to Embedding & Vectorization module
- Exposes OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for frontend and external integration
- Integrates with user/auth service for access control
- System-wide logging and monitoring

## Workflow Description
- User uploads a document via the API
- System parses and extracts text, applies OCR if needed
- Document is chunked and metadata is extracted
- Processed data is stored and made available for embedding
- All actions are logged and monitored
