# Embedding & Vectorization - Checklist

## Milestone 1: Model Selection & Setup (High Priority)
- [ ] Select embedding model(s) (e.g., Sentence Transformers)  
  _Choose and configure the embedding model(s) to be used._
- [ ] Set up model management logic  
  _Enable switching and managing multiple embedding models._

## Milestone 2: Embedding Pipeline (Medium Priority)
- [x] Implement text-to-vector conversion  
  _Convert text chunks into vector representations for downstream search and retrieval._
- [ ] Add batch processing support  
  _Process multiple text chunks in batches for efficiency._
- [ ] Add GPU support for embedding pipeline  
  _Leverage GPU acceleration for faster embedding._

## Milestone 3: Quality & Observability (Medium/Low Priority)
- [ ] Add logging and error handling  
  _Log all operations and handle errors consistently._
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests  
  _Ensure reliability and correctness with automated tests._
- [ ] Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger  
  _Provide interactive API documentation._

## General Dependencies
- [ ] Set up pre-trained embedding models  
  _Install and configure the embedding model(s)._ 
- [ ] Set up GPU hardware (optional)  
  _Install and configure GPU for acceleration._
- [x] Set up FastAPI core  
  _Initialize FastAPI application structure._
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure  
  _Prepare Prometheus, ELK, and related tools._
