# Embedding & Vectorization - Project Overview

## Purpose
The Embedding & Vectorization sub-project is responsible for converting text chunks into vector representations using configurable embedding models. It enables efficient semantic search and retrieval workflows for the Hyperion platform.

## Scope
- Selection and management of embedding models (e.g., Sentence Transformers)
- Text-to-vector conversion for document and query chunks
- Batch and GPU-supported embedding pipeline
- Model versioning and switching
- Logging, error handling, and observability

## Architecture
- Modular FastAPI service structure
- Embedding model management (local or remote)
- Batch processing and GPU acceleration support
- Integration with downstream vector database (Milvus)
- Logging and monitoring integrated with Prometheus and ELK

## Technologies
- FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
- Sentence Transformers or similar models
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (for GPU support)
- Monitoring: Prometheus, ELK stack

## Dependencies
- Pre-trained embedding models (local or remote)
- GPU hardware (optional, for acceleration)
- Environment variables for model paths, batch size, and monitoring endpoints
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Configuration Requirements
- Model selection and configuration (model path, device, batch size)
- Logging and monitoring endpoints

## Integration Points
- Receives text chunks from Document Ingestion & Processing
- Provides vector outputs to Vector Database Integration (Milvus)
- Exposes OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for integration
- System-wide logging and monitoring

## Workflow Description
- Receives text chunks via API or internal call
- Converts text to vectors using the selected model
- Supports batch and GPU processing for efficiency
- Outputs vectors for storage in the vector database
- All actions are logged and monitored
