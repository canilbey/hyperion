# Embedding & Vectorization - Technical Tasks

## Milestone 1: Model Selection & Setup (High Priority)

- **Select embedding model(s) (e.g., Sentence Transformers)**
  - Purpose: Choose and configure the embedding model(s) to be used for text-to-vector conversion.
  - Design: Support for local or remote models, versioning, and configuration.
  - Dependencies: Model files or API access must be available.

- **Set up model management logic**
  - Purpose: Enable switching and managing multiple embedding models.
  - Design: Model registry, configuration endpoints, and validation.
  - Dependencies: Model selection and configuration.

## Milestone 2: Embedding Pipeline (Medium Priority)

- **Implement text-to-vector conversion**
  - Purpose: Convert text chunks into vector representations for downstream search and retrieval.
  - Design: API endpoint or internal function for embedding, input validation, and error handling.
  - Dependencies: Model setup and configuration.

- **Add batch processing support**
  - Purpose: Process multiple text chunks in batches for efficiency.
  - Design: Batch API, queueing, and parallel processing logic.
  - Dependencies: Embedding function, batch config.

- **Add GPU support for embedding pipeline**
  - Purpose: Leverage GPU acceleration for faster embedding.
  - Design: Device selection, CUDA/ROCm support, and fallback to CPU.
  - Dependencies: GPU hardware and drivers.

## Milestone 3: Quality & Observability (Medium/Low Priority)

- **Add logging and error handling**
  - Purpose: Log all operations and handle errors consistently.
  - Design: Structured logging, error categorization, integration with observability stack.
  - Dependencies: Logging infrastructure.

- **Write unit and integration tests**
  - Purpose: Ensure reliability and correctness with automated tests.
  - Design: Test cases for all flows, edge cases, and error conditions.
  - Dependencies: Test framework, model setup.

- **Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger**
  - Purpose: Provide interactive API documentation.
  - Design: Endpoint descriptions, input/output schemas, and error codes.
  - Dependencies: API implementation.
