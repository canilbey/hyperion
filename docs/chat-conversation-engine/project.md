# Chat & Conversation Engine - Project Overview

## Purpose
The Chat & Conversation Engine sub-project manages real-time chat sessions, message history, and context for LLM-powered conversations. It enables scalable, stateful chat interactions, context window management, and seamless integration with LLMs and Redis.

## Scope
- Chat session creation, management, and termination
- Message addition, retrieval, and history management
- Integration with LLMs for context-aware responses
- Context window management for efficient LLM usage
- Redis cache integration for fast access and scalability
- Logging, error handling, and observability

## Architecture
- Modular FastAPI service structure
- PostgreSQL or NoSQL database for persistent chat and message storage
- Redis for session and context caching
- Stateless API endpoints for chat operations
- LLM integration via service API or internal module
- Logging and monitoring integrated with Prometheus and ELK

## Technologies
- FastAPI (Python 3.10+)
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB (chat/message data)
- Redis (session/context cache)
- LLM API (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
- Monitoring: Prometheus, ELK stack

## Dependencies
- Running PostgreSQL or NoSQL instance for chat/message storage
- Redis instance for caching
- LLM service/API credentials and configuration
- Environment variables for DB, Redis, LLM, and monitoring endpoints
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Configuration Requirements
- Database schema for chat sessions and messages
- Redis connection and cache settings
- LLM API keys and endpoint configuration
- Logging and monitoring endpoints

## Integration Points
- Provides chat and context to LLMs and downstream services
- Exposes OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for frontend and external integration
- Integrates with user/auth service for user context
- System-wide logging and monitoring

## Workflow Description
- User initiates or resumes a chat session
- Messages are added and stored in sequence
- Chat history is retrieved and provided to LLM for context
- Context window is managed for optimal LLM performance
- All actions are logged and monitored
