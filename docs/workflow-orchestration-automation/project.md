# Workflow Orchestration & Automation - Project Overview

## Purpose
The Workflow Orchestration & Automation sub-project is responsible for automating and managing document processing, embedding pipelines, and other backend workflows using tools like Apache Airflow. It ensures reliable, scalable, and observable data and task flows across the Hyperion platform.

## Scope
- Orchestration of document ingestion, parsing, and embedding pipelines
- Task scheduling, monitoring, and retry logic
- Integration with backend services (document, embedding, vector DB)
- Error handling, alerting, and logging for workflows
- Automated data validation and quality checks
- Extensible DAGs for new workflows

## Architecture
- Apache Airflow (or similar) for workflow orchestration
- Modular DAGs for each major pipeline (ingestion, embedding, etc.)
- Integration with backend APIs and databases
- Logging and monitoring integrated with Prometheus, ELK, and Airflow UI

## Technologies
- Apache Airflow (Python 3.10+)
- FastAPI (for service integration)
- PostgreSQL, Milvus, Redis (as workflow targets)
- Monitoring: Prometheus, ELK stack, Airflow UI

## Dependencies
- Running Apache Airflow instance
- Backend API endpoints for all orchestrated services
- Environment variables for API URLs, DB connections, and monitoring
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Configuration Requirements
- Airflow DAG and operator configuration
- API endpoint and authentication settings
- Logging and monitoring endpoints

## Integration Points
- Triggers and monitors document, embedding, and vector DB workflows
- Receives events from and sends tasks to backend services
- System-wide logging, alerting, and monitoring

## Workflow Description
- Schedules and triggers document ingestion and embedding pipelines
- Monitors task status, retries on failure, and alerts on errors
- Logs all workflow steps and results for observability
- Extensible for new data and ML workflows
