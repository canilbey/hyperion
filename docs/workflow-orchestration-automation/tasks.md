# Workflow Orchestration & Automation - Technical Tasks

## Milestone 1: Core Workflow Setup (High Priority)

- **Set up Apache Airflow instance and core configuration**
  - Purpose: Provide orchestration and scheduling for backend workflows.
  - Design: Airflow deployment, DAG folder structure, and environment setup.
  - Dependencies: Airflow infrastructure, environment variables.

- **Develop DAGs for document ingestion and embedding pipelines**
  - Purpose: Automate document processing and embedding workflows.
  - Design: Modular DAGs for each pipeline, task dependencies, and scheduling.
  - Dependencies: Backend API endpoints, storage configuration.

## Milestone 2: Monitoring, Error Handling & Extensibility (Medium Priority)

- **Integrate logging, monitoring, and alerting**
  - Purpose: Ensure all workflow steps are observable and errors are reported.
  - Design: Log export to ELK, metrics to Prometheus, alerting via Airflow and external tools.
  - Dependencies: Logging/monitoring stack, Airflow configuration.

- **Implement task retry and failure handling logic**
  - Purpose: Improve workflow reliability and resilience.
  - Design: Retry policies, failure callbacks, and error notifications.
  - Dependencies: Airflow DAG/task configuration.

- **Add automated data validation and quality checks**
  - Purpose: Ensure data integrity and quality at each workflow step.
  - Design: Validation tasks, schema checks, and reporting.
  - Dependencies: Data schemas, validation logic.

## Milestone 3: Extending Workflows & Quality (Medium/Low Priority)

- **Develop DAGs for new data and ML workflows**
  - Purpose: Support additional pipelines (e.g., retraining, analytics).
  - Design: Modular, reusable DAGs and operators.
  - Dependencies: New workflow requirements, API endpoints.

- **Write unit and integration tests for DAGs and operators**
  - Purpose: Ensure reliability and correctness with automated tests.
  - Design: Test cases for all DAGs, edge cases, and error conditions.
  - Dependencies: Test framework, Airflow test environment.

- **Document all workflows and DAGs**
  - Purpose: Provide clear documentation for all orchestrated workflows.
  - Design: Markdown docs, Airflow UI descriptions.
  - Dependencies: Workflow implementation.
